\section{Introduction}
Cardiff School of Technologies degrees are designed to prepare you for a
career shaping the future of technology. From day one, you will be
encouraged to adopt a growth mindset, strengthening your ability to learn
autonomously. Making use of our state-of-the-art dedicated labs, you will
be able to put theory into practice and gain the skills you need to succeed
in an evolving digital world. \cite{JenkinsAndAngel2006}

\section{Lecturers}
You will be taught by academics and practitioners, who will provide insights
into their research and enterprise activity. Through guest lectures from
industry partners, interactive workshops, and real-world problems for
assessments, our network of experts will bring specialist knowledge and best
practices to the classroom. Furthermore, many of our programmes are integrated
with professional certification contents such as SAS, Tableau, Cisco and
Certified Ethical Hacking (CEH), to give you an edge in todayâ€™s competitive job
market. \citep{JenkinsAndAngel2006}

\section{Industry experience}
To strengthen the bond with employers, all degrees give you the
opportunity to gain industry experience through optional work-based
learning modules. You are able to complete a year out on placement or take
part in our practical industry-based Hackathons. Additionally, we work
closely with our international academic partners to offer you
opportunities to study and work abroad.
